# JETP_2D

The project is dedicated to predicting the properties of films of quasi-two-dimensional materials from their optical images using convolutional neural networks.

The repository contains files: 
1. Jupyter Notebook with neural network code 
2. Example of a used dataset (the dataset is self-assembled based on experimental results, so it cannot be posted to the public)
